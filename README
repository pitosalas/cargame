One of the problems was simply getting a city map that looks 'right' in terms of proportions.

Notes about roads and blocks (from wikipedia)

- A city block is 300x300' (there are variants to this but I thought it was a good average). This includes the sidewalk
1/2 of the street
- A driving lane is around 10'
- A sidewalk is around 6'
